  abstract = {A concept map is deemed a useful teaching and learning tool. It offers many potential advantages over just representing the students' knowledge and understanding during learning, and have been widely used to support learning. Kit-Build concept map is one learning framework that incorporate digital concept map for its learning activities. Learning with Kit-Build concept map has been found to have better learning effects towards students' understanding and knowledge retention. Incorporating Kit-Build concept map into collaborative learning have been reported to have better outcome than the traditional collaborative learning. However, collaborative learning with Kit-Build concept map cannot be accomodated with the current Kit-Build system where learning activity is conducted online. This study presents the design and development of online collaborative learning platform of Kit-Build Concept Map. A prototype of the collaboration system to support collaborative learning with Kit-Build concept map is developed and be evaluated to portray its potential usability for further development and practical use. The result suggested that incorporating Socket.IO as a real-time communication middleware is effective to deliver online collaborative learning features into the Kit-Build system. Preliminary evaluation to the system also suggested that the system has the potential for actual use in supporting distant collaborative learning with Kit-Build concept map.},

  abstract = {Apart from contributing to students' learning outcomes, learning activities with digital concept maps were useful, fun, and engaging. Kit-Build concept map is a learning framework that incorporated concept map recomposition as its essential activity. It has been used to learn English as a Foreign Language (EFL) reading comprehension. Students learn through recomposing digital concept maps from a set of teacher's concept map components; hence, the teacher's concept map is essential in Kit-Build. A teacher's concept map should reflect the learning context and strategy, the teacher's purpose and intention, students' understanding level, and focus questions. However, automatic-generated concept maps with Concept Map Mining (CMM) can only produce general concept maps that are not fit and difficult to correspond to said reasons. As teacher's concept maps are essential in learning with Kit-Build, improving teachers' productivity in composing concept maps of a particular learning material becomes necessary. This study proposed a semi-automatic concept map generation approach of EFL reading comprehension texts with CMM to assist teachers composed their concept maps. The proposed concept map generation approach was integrated into the current Kit-Build concept map authoring tool as an authoring support feature. The accuracy of the support feature in generating concept map components is presented in this research. The result suggested that the proposed authoring support tool is better used to refine a concept map.},
